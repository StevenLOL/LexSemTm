Scripts
-------

The main scripts come with their own man page so use the 
option "--man" to get the manpage:
e.g.,   ./cooc2pmi.pl --man
Though for this to work, you must have Perl's "pod2usage" 
programme installed  and the appearance isn't great!

Generate PMI, NPMI or robust version of PMI from the output of
of linkCoco (see DCA-Bags):
      cooc2pmi.pl

Take the above produced PMI/NPMI file and specialise it
for the current data set (i.e.,  project onto the specific
dictionary):
      mkmat.pl

Process the ".word" output from linkTables to create a 
proportion vector matching the dictionary file.
Can be used with the "-u" option to "hca".
      mkbetapr.pl

Run different tests using hca with
      runtest.pl

When a "-lsp,2,1" style command is used with "hca" it
reads the STEM.smap file for a list of word indices and then
creates sparsity data (i.e. topic strengths) for each of
the words.  This is output to RESTEM.smap.  Create a
nice PNG figure with these using:
       plotsmap.pl

Routines process the sparse matrix format of 
      http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words
   spcat.pl -- merge two files
   spcut.pl --  take first N records out of file
   spprint.pl -- print a matrix with words, assuming both rows and columns
                are indexes to the vocab file
   spthin.pl -- thin out vocabulary

Routine used with collections having an ".epoch", to generate
a train-test split and create the matching ".epoch" file.
Works with ldac or txtbag data only.
   berand.pl

but no self-contained man entries.
