4 zombie argumentsdavid chalmers believe zombie be a challenge to physicalism . accord to physicalism the physical fact determine all other fact it follow that since all the fact about a p-zombie be fix by the physical fact and these fact be the same for the p-zombie and for the normal conscious human from which it cannot be physically distinguish physicalism must hold that p-zomby be not possible or that p-zomby be the same as normal human . therefore zombie argument support line of reasoning that aim to show that zombie be possible .

1 the zombie argument against physicalism be therefore a version of a general modal argument against physicalism such as that of saul kripke s in naming and necessity 1972 . however note that kripke s modal argument in naming and necessity be against only one kind of physicalism type-identity theory . the notion of a p-zombie as use to argue against physicalism be notably advance in the 1970s by thomas nagel 1970 1974 and robert kirk 1974 .
2 however the zombie argument against physicalism in general be most famously develop in detail by david chalmers in the conscious mind 1996 . accord to chalmers one can coherently conceive of an entire zombie world a world physically indiscernible from our world but entirely lack conscious experience . in such a world the counterpart of every being that be conscious in our world would be a p-zombie .

36 the argument be logically valid in that if its premise be true then the conclusion must be true . however philosopher dispute that its premise be true . for example concern premise 2 be such a zombie world really possible chalmers state that it certainly seem that a coherent situation be describe i can discern no contradiction in the description . chalmers 1996 p . 96 .
44 since such a world be conceivable chalmers claim it be possible and if such a world be possible then physicalism be false . chalmers be argue only for logical possibility and he maintain that this be all that his argument require . he state zombie be probably not naturally possible they probably cannot exist in our world with its law of nature . chalmers 2003 p . 5 .
52 this lead to the follow question what be the relevant notion of possibility here be the scenario in premise 2 possible in the sense that be suggest in premise 1 some philosopher maintain that the relevant kind of possibility be not so weak as logical possibility . they argue that while a zombie world be logically possible that be there be no logical contradiction in any full description of the scenario such a weak notion be not relevant in the analysis of a metaphysical thesis such as physicalism . most philosopher agree that the relevant notion of possibility be some sort of metaphysical possibility . what the proponent of the zombie argument claim be that one can tell from the armchair just by the power of reason that such a zombie scenario be metaphysically possible .
63 they argue that while a zombie world be logically possible that be there be no logical contradiction in any full description of the scenario such a weak notion be not relevant in the analysis of a metaphysical thesis such as physicalism . most philosopher agree that the relevant notion of possibility be some sort of metaphysical possibility . what the proponent of the zombie argument claim be that one can tell from the armchair just by the power of reason that such a zombie scenario be metaphysically possible . chalmers state from the conceivability of zombie proponent of the argument infer their metaphysical possibility . chalmers claim that this inference from conceivability to metaphysical possibility be not generally legitimate but it be legitimate for phenomenal concept such as consciousness .
